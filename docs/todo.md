# Upcoming tasks

## Update delivery information when done
The current update delivery is not fully done as there are coding errors in comments text field, need to be fixed.

## Implement Route optimization
Currently, route optimization page only shows locations of consignments. It does not have a function to optimize route based on driver's location.

## Search filter in mobile version
Need to implement a search filter for mobile version, so drivers can search consignment easily.

# Nice-to-have 

## Route
Route works similarly to postcode, but applying to drivers. Each consignment belongs to one route, and all consignments in the same route will be done in sequence.
